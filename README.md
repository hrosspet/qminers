# Interview task for QMiners

This project serves as a showcase of how a high number of machine learning models (both classical and neural networks) can be systematically evaluated on a toy dataset, such that the best model is found.

My solution is described in `diskuze.pdf`. You can also find there the experimental results on toy datasets and an explanation of possible alternative approaches.
